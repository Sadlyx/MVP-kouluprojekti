	<h1 class="title">Agile software development</h1>
	<p>There are many types of software development: Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), DSDM, Crystal Methods, Agile modeling, Adaptive software development, Pragmatic Programming, Feature driven development and Gilb-EVO. Most of these aim to minimize risks by sharing the software development into short iterations that usually last for one to four weeks. Every iteration aims for a publish ready software, even if the product wouldn't be ready by the end of the iteration. The project is re-estimated at the end of each iteration and the content of the next iteration is decided. Planning is happening all the time, throughout the project. Agile software development finds direct communication more important than written documents. An agile team consists of at least programmers and their custommers. The team can also have testers, user interface designers and leaders.</p>

	<h1 class="title">Waterfall model</h1>
	<p>Waterfall model is a phased production process, where planning and execution progres phase by phase downwards like a waterfall. Unlike in agile software development, the production process is planned ahead and not changed later. The time spent in early phases planning saves time and effort in later phases. The waterfall model works perfectly only when every phase is planned 100% right before moving to the next phase. The waterfall model emphasizes comprehensive, written documents instead of more direct communication. The waterfall model is found to be lacking because it's believed that it is impossible to plan any bigger software perfectly ahead of time without returning to earlier phases later in the project.</p>
